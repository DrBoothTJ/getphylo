# getphylo
a python package for automated generation of heuristic phylogenetic trees from genbank files

## Description

## Usage
This package has been designed to be as easy to run as possible. Simply navigate to a working directory containing .gbk files and input:

`getphylo`

This will run the software on default settings and output all alignments and trees.

There may be occasions where you need to change the default settings. A full list of options and flags can be viewed with:

`getphylo -h`
